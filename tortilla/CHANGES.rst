Version 0.4.2
-------------

Released on May 18th 2016. Changes by `@osantana`_ in `#29`_.

- Formatting code to make it more PEP-8 compliant
- Simplify py2/3 compatibility code (remove compat module)
- Enable/disable httpretty in setUp/tearDown methods in tests to make
  it works with all kind of test runners (like PyCharm test runner or
  nose)
- Refactor ``run_from_ipython()`` implementation to make it pass static
  code analysis test (warns for missing ``__IPYTHON__``)
- Fix an issue with ``delay`` code when it was called for the first
  time and ``self._last_request_time`` is ``None``
